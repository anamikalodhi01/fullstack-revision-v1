// The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory.
// The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

//  A DOM tree is a tree structure whose nodes represent an HTML or XML document's contents. Each HTML or XML document has a DOM tree representation.

//  The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.
