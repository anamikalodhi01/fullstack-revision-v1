    <h1>Defer Attribute Example</h1>
    <p>This page demonstrates the use of the defer attribute in script tags.</p>

    // how to add console log in html file
    <script>
        console.log("This is defer.html file");
    </script>

  
    <!-- // async defer does what ?
    The async attribute allows the script to be downloaded in parallel with other resources,
     while the defer attribute 
      ensures that the script is executed only after the HTML document has been 
      fully parsed. When both attributes are used together, the script 
      will be downloaded asynchronously but will still wait to 
      execute until after the document parsing is complete. -->
