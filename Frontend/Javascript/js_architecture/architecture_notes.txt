Js Architecture 

1. Architecture
2. Event Loop
3. Browser runtime

//dev --> request --> |     |     __________    ____ async (non blocking)
                      |     | --> Event Loop --|
                      |     |     ___________   ____ sync
// js is single-treaded but the os/server/browser is multi-treaded


// what is applets in java ??

// libuv - a c++ library 
(what livuv in node does?)
Ans: libuv is a cross-platform, open-source C library that provides the core
 infrastructure for Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture. It acts as 
 the backbone that enables Node.js to perform asynchronous I/O operations efficiently, 
 even though JavaScript itself runs on a single thread. 

 // Monolithic vs microservice archiecture
 -- explain
-- Monolithic Architecture:
A single, unified application where all components (UI, business logic, database access, etc.) 
are tightly coupled.
Example: A large e-commerce app where login, product catalog, cart, and payment all exist in one codebase.
-- Microservice Architecture:
The application is split into multiple independent services,
each handling a specific business function.
Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Example: The same e-commerce app split into User Service, Catalog Service, Payment Service, Order Service.

// Hoisting -- in javascript the variable declaration moves to the top thenafter that value assingnation
comes into picture 

console.log(a); // prints undefined
let a=5 ;
console.log(a); // prints 5

// splice and slice functions -- read and learn

arr = [1,2,3,,5] -- double comma throws no error
it means [1,2,3, empty, 5] 

arr.shift() -- removes 1st element of arr and returns it
arr = [2,3,,5]

arr.unshift() -- removes last element of arr abd returns it
arr=[2,3,]

empty!=null
arr[2]=null

// bitwise shift <<< , >>> (left shift , right shift)
